# tdt4173-webpage
This repo contains a react webpage showing the results of a project in the course TDT4173 â€“ machine learning at NTNU. The repository for the machine learning project can be found here: <https://github.com/SimenHolmestad/TDT4173-project>.

The website is currently hosted at <https://simenholmestad.github.io/TDT4173-webpage/>, and continous integration is set up so that the frontend is automatically deployed when pushing to master.

The reason that the website is a bit slow as of now is that we are running a machine learning model directly inside a google cloud function for the backend.
